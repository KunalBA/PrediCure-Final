# PrediCure-Final
The project encompasses both front-end and back-end development. The back-end will consist of Python ML models responsible for making primary disease predictions, while the front-end will manage user inputs and outputs through a web interface. Users visiting the website will interact with an interactive web application, selecting specific diseases and corresponding parameters. The application will then process these inputs, sending them to the back-end model for evaluation, and display the outcomes back to the user on the front-end interface. Also, there will be a diet recommender system for recommending some diet plans for improving health and fighting disease.
